# Reading List
At this point in my life, I need to develop expertise in GPU computing, the Julia programming language, and 
FEM and domain decomposition. But for some reason I am always drawn (back) to these other topics/skills etc in
my "spare" time.
CS:APP had quite an impact on me for some reason, even though I am much less than halfway through the tome.

In principle should aim for mastery in whatever I pursue professionally/academically regardless of the content
itself. It remains to be seen if I can adopt this principle faithfully.

My bucket list for technical (and some non-technical) reading. I have read parts of some of them.
Sometimes life got in the way (LOL), other times  the book itself is a fat tome.
If the book has accompanying projects or exercises (e.g. in
CS:APP, and even Linkers and Loaders) then I want to work through those as well.

Some of these are probably better suited as reference books rather than cover-to-cover
reading material, e.g. Hennessy and Patterson. I do not know if it is possible to cover
all of them properly in one lifetime, even if I put into use knowledge and skills from only
a few.
