# Reading List
My bucket list for technical (and some non-technical) reading. I have read parts of some of them.
Sometimes life got in the way (LOL), other times  the book itself is a fat tome.
If the book has accompanying projects or exercises (e.g. in
CS:APP, and even Linkers and Loaders) then I want to work through those as well.

Some of these are probably better suited as reference books rather than cover-to-cover
reading material, e.g. Hennessy and Patterson. I do not know if it is possible to cover
all of them properly in one lifetime, even if I put into use knowledge and skills from only
a few.
